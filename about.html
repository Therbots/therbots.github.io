        <h2>I was a areomedical technician in the air force.  Now I'm studying full stack development, which includes but not limited to languages such as python, javascript and SQL. 
            I'm married to my beautiful wife. We've been married for 2 years and together for 6.  We don't have any children yet but we do have animals.
            I love animals!  My wife and I have 2 cats, a dog and a leopard gecko.
            I'm a passionate about my San Antonio Spurs basketball team! Go Spurs Go!  I pretty much love all sports and watch most of them.  I truly enjoy and get really excited for the olympics.
            I really enjoy playing video games.  I have around 300 titles on my PC alone.  I also have a Nintendo switch and a playstation 4.
